Check to see if there is or was maintenance being performed on the affected chassis linecard. Isolate the device and open up Cisco TAC case if the issue couldn t be root caused.Troubleshooting Guidelines:1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It is possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload.If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.2) Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.3) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the failed in keyword in the given syslog. In this example it is linecard 0 0. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:show platformadmin show platformLinecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:0 2 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUTIf any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.3) Check the system for active alarms:show alarms brief system activeAny alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.4) How many linecards are down? If more than XX cards are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.5) Check the fabric plane health:admin show controller fabric plane all detailPlane Admin Plane up->dn up->mcastId State State counter counter--------------------------------------0 UP UP 0 01 UP UP 0 02 UP UP 0 03 UP UP 0 04 UP UP 0 05 UP UP 0 0Healthy fabric planes will be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.6) Compare routing and ARP ND tables with those of other devices in the same role to identify cause of LPM or LEM table exhaustion (either due to a large number of ARP ND entries or a large number of routes).RP 0 RP0 CPU0:NCS5508-T3-1#show arp | utility wc77 442 5718Compare the word counts between the devices; save the comparison for the TAC case.7) Check the network processor (NPU) resources:show controller npu resources all location 0 0 CPU0HW Resource InformationName : lemOOR InformationNPU-0Estimated Max Entries : 786432Red Threshold : 95 %Yellow Threshold : 80 %OOR State : GreenCurrent UsageNPU-0Total In-Use : XXXXX (X %)iproute : XXXXX (X %)ip6route : XXXXX (X %)mplslabel : XXXXX (X %)Look at LEM, LPM, EEDB tables for OOR State.

It can reject old or duplicate packets to protect itself against replay attacks. The possible triggering conditions for this error to occur are1. The IPSec encrypted packets are forwarded out of order by the encrypting router, this is typically a result of QOS (quality of service) configuration on the encrypting router.2. The IPSec packets received by the decrypting router are out of order due to packet reordering at an intermediate device, most commonly the ISP (Internet service provider) issue.3. The received IPSec packet is fragmented and requires reassembly before authentication verification and decryption. Since the reassembly process is taking place at the process level, it's possible that by the time the large packet is reassembled, the default smaller packets have already been processed by the crypto engine, thus causing the large packet to miss the anti-replay window.4.
