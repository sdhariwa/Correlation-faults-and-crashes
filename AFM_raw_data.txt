                  description: The Data Plane Agent (DPA), which monitors the system data-plane databases, has detected warning condition that the given IPv4 or IPv6 route has failed to install into the Longest Prefix Match(LPM) or Large Exact Match Database (LEM) table.

Routes are not installed in the hardware and packets are being dropped. LEM or LPM tables to hold the IPv4 6 routes has crossed 100% threshold. Each Forwarding ASIC (FA) in NCS5500 is made of two cores (0 and 1). Each of these FA have an ingress and egress pipeline. Each pipeline itself is made of different blocks. Along the pipeline, the different blocks can access (read or write) different databases. Separate memory entities are used to store specific type of information, as follows:

• The Longest Prefix Match Database (LPM)—sometimes referred to as KBP Assisted Prefix Search (KAPS) or Knowledge Based Processor (KBP)—is SRAM used to store IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes. It’s an algorithmic memory that can store up to 256k IPv4 entries and 128k IPv6 entries.
• The Large Exact Match Database (LEM) is also used to store IPv4 and IPv6 routes, MAC addresses, and MPLS labels—it scales to 786k entries.
• The internal TCAM (iTCAM) is used for packet classification (ACL, QoS), and can store 48k entries.
• The FEC database is used to store next-hop (128k entries), containing also the FEC ECMP (4k entries).

Depending on the IPv4 or IPv6 address, family and the prefix-length routes will be sorted and stored in LEM, LPM or eTCAM. Route handling depends on the platform type, the IOS XR release running and the profile activated. The  show controller npu resources all location R S M  command shows the current usage of TCAM resources for the linecard with the maximum entry limitations, and the associated thresholds, and states.

DPA is the Data Plane Agent, an abstraction layer between RIB and Hardware resources. If a database (LEM, LPM, eTCAM) capacity is exceed, DPA will stop programming any new prefixes and the Hw failures counter will increment.

This issue could happen for any of the following reasons:
1) Software issue;
2) Stale entries;
3) Misconfiguration;
4) Incorrect route-filtering or summarization.

Determine the cause of LEM LPM table exhaustion in the affected linecard. Check to see if there is or was maintenance being performed on the affected chassis linecard. Isolate the device and open up Cisco TAC case if the issue couldn t be root caused.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It is possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

3) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the failed in keyword in the given syslog. In this example it is linecard 0 0. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 2 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

4) How many linecards are down? If more than XX cards are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

5) Check the fabric plane health:

admin show controller fabric plane all detail

Plane Admin Plane up->dn up->mcast
Id State State counter counter
--------------------------------------
0 UP UP 0 0
1 UP UP 0 0
2 UP UP 0 0
3 UP UP 0 0
4 UP UP 0 0
5 UP UP 0 0

Healthy fabric planes will be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

6) Compare routing and ARP ND tables with those of other devices in the same role to identify cause of LPM or LEM table exhaustion (either due to a large number of ARP ND entries or a large number of routes).

RP 0 RP0 CPU0:NCS5508-T3-1#show arp | utility wc
 77 442 5718

Compare the word counts between the devices; save the comparison for the TAC case.

7) Check the network processor (NPU) resources:

show controller npu resources all location 0 0 CPU0

HW Resource Information
 Name : lem

OOR Information
 NPU-0
 Estimated Max Entries : 786432
 Red Threshold : 95 %
 Yellow Threshold : 80 %
 OOR State : Green

Current Usage
 NPU-0
 Total In-Use : XXXXX (X %)
 iproute : XXXXX (X %)
 ip6route : XXXXX (X %)
 mplslabel : XXXXX (X %)

Look at LEM, LPM, EEDB tables for OOR State. Compare the out of range (OOR) information with the current useage information to find the source of the problem.

8) Look for possible misconfiguration (e.g. incorrect route filtering or summarization, hosts generating large number of ARP ND entries). This requires knowledge of BGPand ARP protocols and the ability to use the commands for diagnosis. For one-on-one help drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10. For reference guides refer to https: www.cisco.com c en us support ios-nx-os-software ios-xr-software products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html for configuration guides.

show bgp <IPV4 IPV6> unicast summary
show bgp policy

9) Check total number of BGP prefixes for v4 and v6 and filter if needed. If there are prefixes that are unnecessary, create a filter and apply accordingly. This requires knowledge of BGP and ARP protocols and the ability to use the commands for diagnosis. For one-on-one help drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10. For reference guides refer to https: www.cisco.com c en us support ios-nx-os-software ios-xr-software products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html for configuration guides.

show bgp <IPV4 IPV6> unicast summary

10) If the problem has not be resolved, collect the following command output:

show bgp <IPV4 IPV6> unicast summary
show bgp policy
show controller npu resources all location <LC> (Run this command for all the linecard)
show dpa resources iproute location <> (Run this command for all the linecard)
admin show platform
show version
admin show inventory
show running
admin show running
show logging
admin show logging

11) Open up Cisco TAC Case.

                  description: Cisco IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) authentication provides anti-replay protection against duplicating encrypted packets by assigning a unique sequence number to each encrypted packet. It can reject old or duplicate packets to protect itself against replay attacks. The possible triggering conditions for this error to occur are:
1. The IPSec encrypted packets are forwarded out of order by the encrypting router, this is typically a result of QOS (quality of service) configuration on the encrypting router.
2. The IPSec packets received by the decrypting router are out of order due to packet reordering at an intermediate device, most commonly the ISP (Internet service provider) issue.
3. The received IPSec packet is fragmented and requires reassembly before authentication verification and decryption. Since the reassembly process is taking place at the process level, it's possible that by the time the large packet is reassembled, the default smaller packets have already been processed by the crypto engine, thus causing the large packet to miss the anti-replay window.
4. Network latency, transmission path issues.

                       impact: A parity error in the Integrated Packet Processor's Transmit Management Module. This could be a transient hardware issue or a fatal error. There are two groups of parity errors.

Soft Parity Errors:
These errors occur when an energy level within the chip (for example, a one or a zero) changes, most often due to radiation.
When referenced by the CPU, such errors cause the system to crash. In case of a soft parity error, there is no need to swap the board or any of the components.

Hard parity errors
These errors occur when there is a chip or board failure that corrupts data. In this case, you need to re-seat or replace the affected
component, which usually involves a memory chip swap or a board swap.

Routes are not installed in the hardware and packets are being dropped. LEM or LPM tables to hold the IPv4 6 routes has crossed 100% threshold. Each Forwarding ASIC (FA) in NCS5500 is made of two cores (0 and 1). Each of these FA have an ingress and egress pipeline. Each pipeline itself is made of different blocks. Along the pipeline, the different blocks can access (read or write) different databases. Separate memory entities are used to store specific type of information, as follows:

• The Longest Prefix Match Database (LPM)—sometimes referred to as KBP Assisted Prefix Search (KAPS) or Knowledge Based Processor (KBP)—is SRAM used to store IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes. It’s an algorithmic memory that can store up to 256k IPv4 entries and 128k IPv6 entries.
• The Large Exact Match Database (LEM) is also used to store IPv4 and IPv6 routes, MAC addresses, and MPLS labels—it scales to 786k entries.
• The internal TCAM (iTCAM) is used for packet classification (ACL, QoS), and can store 48k entries.
• The FEC database is used to store next-hop (128k entries), containing also the FEC ECMP (4k entries).

Depending on the IPv4 or IPv6 address, family and the prefix-length routes will be sorted and stored in LEM, LPM or eTCAM. Route handling depends on the platform type, the IOS XR release running and the profile activated. The  show controller npu resources all location R S M  command shows the current usage of TCAM resources for the linecard with the maximum entry limitations, and the associated thresholds, and states.

DPA is the Data Plane Agent, an abstraction layer between RIB and Hardware resources. If a database (LEM, LPM, eTCAM) capacity is exceed, DPA will stop programming any new prefixes and the Hw failures counter will increment.

This issue could happen for any of the following reasons:
1) Software issue;
2) Stale entries;
3) Misconfiguration;
4) Incorrect route-filtering or summarization.

                  remediation: Objective:
Determine the cause of LEM LPM table exhaustion in the affected linecard. Check to see if there is or was maintenance being performed on the affected chassis linecard. Isolate the device and open up Cisco TAC case if the issue couldn t be root caused.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It is possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

3) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the failed in keyword in the given syslog. In this example it is linecard 0 0. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 2 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

4) How many linecards are down? If more than XX cards are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

5) Check the fabric plane health:

admin show controller fabric plane all detail

Plane Admin Plane up->dn up->mcast
Id State State counter counter
--------------------------------------
0 UP UP 0 0
1 UP UP 0 0
2 UP UP 0 0
3 UP UP 0 0
4 UP UP 0 0
5 UP UP 0 0

Healthy fabric planes will be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

6) Compare routing and ARP ND tables with those of other devices in the same role to identify cause of LPM or LEM table exhaustion (either due to a large number of ARP ND entries or a large number of routes).

RP 0 RP0 CPU0:NCS5508-T3-1#show arp | utility wc
 77 442 5718

Compare the word counts between the devices; save the comparison for the TAC case.

7) Check the network processor (NPU) resources:

show controller npu resources all location 0 0 CPU0

HW Resource Information
 Name : lem

OOR Information
 NPU-0
 Estimated Max Entries : 786432
 Red Threshold : 95 %
 Yellow Threshold : 80 %
 OOR State : Green

Current Usage
 NPU-0
 Total In-Use : XXXXX (X %)
 iproute : XXXXX (X %)
 ip6route : XXXXX (X %)
 mplslabel : XXXXX (X %)

Look at LEM, LPM, EEDB tables for OOR State. Compare the out of range (OOR) information with the current useage information to find the source of the problem.

8) Look for possible misconfiguration (e.g. incorrect route filtering or summarization, hosts generating large number of ARP ND entries). This requires knowledge of BGPand ARP protocols and the ability to use the commands for diagnosis. For one-on-one help drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10. For reference guides refer to https: www.cisco.com c en us support ios-nx-os-software ios-xr-software products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html for configuration guides.

show bgp <IPV4 IPV6> unicast summary
show bgp policy

9) Check total number of BGP prefixes for v4 and v6 and filter if needed. If there are prefixes that are unnecessary, create a filter and apply accordingly. This requires knowledge of BGP and ARP protocols and the ability to use the commands for diagnosis. For one-on-one help drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10. For reference guides refer to https: www.cisco.com c en us support ios-nx-os-software ios-xr-software products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html for configuration guides.

show bgp <IPV4 IPV6> unicast summary

10) If the problem has not be resolved, collect the following command output:

show bgp <IPV4 IPV6> unicast summary
show bgp policy
show controller npu resources all location <LC> (Run this command for all the linecard)
show dpa resources iproute location <> (Run this command for all the linecard)
admin show platform
show version
admin show inventory
show running
admin show running
show logging
admin show logging

11) Open up Cisco TAC Case.

                  description: The Data Plane Agent (DPA), which monitors the system data-plane databases, has detected warning condition that the given IPv4 or IPv6 route has failed to install into the Longest Prefix Match(LPM) or Large Exact Match Database (LEM) table.

Routes are not installed in the hardware and packets are being dropped. LEM or LPM tables to hold the IPv4 6 routes has crossed 100% threshold. Each Forwarding ASIC (FA) in NCS5500 is made of two cores (0 and 1). Each of these FA have an ingress and egress pipeline. Each pipeline itself is made of different blocks. Along the pipeline, the different blocks can access (read or write) different databases. Separate memory entities are used to store specific type of information, as follows:

• The Longest Prefix Match Database (LPM)—sometimes referred to as KBP Assisted Prefix Search (KAPS) or Knowledge Based Processor (KBP)—is SRAM used to store IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes. It’s an algorithmic memory that can store up to 256k IPv4 entries and 128k IPv6 entries.
• The Large Exact Match Database (LEM) is also used to store IPv4 and IPv6 routes, MAC addresses, and MPLS labels—it scales to 786k entries.
• The internal TCAM (iTCAM) is used for packet classification (ACL, QoS), and can store 48k entries.
• The FEC database is used to store next-hop (128k entries), containing also the FEC ECMP (4k entries).

Depending on the IPv4 or IPv6 address, family and the prefix-length routes will be sorted and stored in LEM, LPM or eTCAM. Route handling depends on the platform type, the IOS XR release running and the profile activated. The  show controller npu resources all location R S M  command shows the current usage of TCAM resources for the linecard with the maximum entry limitations, and the associated thresholds, and states.

DPA is the Data Plane Agent, an abstraction layer between RIB and Hardware resources. If a database (LEM, LPM, eTCAM) capacity is exceed, DPA will stop programming any new prefixes and the Hw failures counter will increment.

This issue could happen for any of the following reasons:
1) Software issue;
2) Stale entries;
3) Misconfiguration;
4) Incorrect route-filtering or summarization.

Determine the cause of LEM LPM table exhaustion in the affected linecard. Check to see if there is or was maintenance being performed on the affected chassis linecard. Isolate the device and open up Cisco TAC case if the issue couldn t be root caused.

Troubleshooting Guidelines:
1) Check to see if there is any active maintenance in progress.

Any active maintenance on the chassis maybe a factor in causing this issue. If you find that there is maintenance on the chassis, then follow up with the relevant team driving the maintenance. It is possible that the syslog messages are a result of a card reload.

If you find that there is no maintenance on the chassis, then you will need to use the following steps to investigate the problem and open a Cisco TAC case.

2) Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

3) Identify the source of the problem (specific linecard location information) from the syslog message. You should be able to find this after the failed in keyword in the given syslog. In this example it is linecard 0 0. For details on how the output of the commands in this TSG are used, refer to the Health Check Playbook.

To identify the faulty hardware from the following commands:

show platform
admin show platform

Linecards that are healthy will have an SW State of OPERATIONAL, and a Config State of NSHUT, as shown below:

0 2 NC55-36X100G OPERATIONAL OPERATIONAL NSHUT

If any fabric cards (shown as FCx x) are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

3) Check the system for active alarms:

show alarms brief system active

Any alarms not related to this specific linecard indicate a larger issue. Drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

4) How many linecards are down? If more than XX cards are down, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

5) Check the fabric plane health:

admin show controller fabric plane all detail

Plane Admin Plane up->dn up->mcast
Id State State counter counter
--------------------------------------
0 UP UP 0 0
1 UP UP 0 0
2 UP UP 0 0
3 UP UP 0 0
4 UP UP 0 0
5 UP UP 0 0

Healthy fabric planes will be displayed in the UP state; fabric planes in the MCAST_DOWN, or DOWN state indicate a problem. The system can operate with only one operational (UP UP) fabric plane, however it will be traffic impacting. If more than one fabric plane has an issue, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10. If any of the fabric planes are in the MCAST_DOWN state, monitor them for 15 minutes. If they remain in that state, drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10.

6) Compare routing and ARP ND tables with those of other devices in the same role to identify cause of LPM or LEM table exhaustion (either due to a large number of ARP ND entries or a large number of routes).

RP 0 RP0 CPU0:NCS5508-T3-1#show arp | utility wc
 77 442 5718

Compare the word counts between the devices; save the comparison for the TAC case.

7) Check the network processor (NPU) resources:

show controller npu resources all location 0 0 CPU0

HW Resource Information
 Name : lem

OOR Information
 NPU-0
 Estimated Max Entries : 786432
 Red Threshold : 95 %
 Yellow Threshold : 80 %
 OOR State : Green

Current Usage
 NPU-0
 Total In-Use : XXXXX (X %)
 iproute : XXXXX (X %)
 ip6route : XXXXX (X %)
 mplslabel : XXXXX (X %)

Look at LEM, LPM, EEDB tables for OOR State. Compare the out of range (OOR) information with the current useage information to find the source of the problem.

8) Look for possible misconfiguration (e.g. incorrect route filtering or summarization, hosts generating large number of ARP ND entries). This requires knowledge of BGPand ARP protocols and the ability to use the commands for diagnosis. For one-on-one help drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10. For reference guides refer to https: www.cisco.com c en us support ios-nx-os-software ios-xr-software products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html for configuration guides.

show bgp <IPV4 IPV6> unicast summary
show bgp policy

9) Check total number of BGP prefixes for v4 and v6 and filter if needed. If there are prefixes that are unnecessary, create a filter and apply accordingly. This requires knowledge of BGP and ARP protocols and the ability to use the commands for diagnosis. For one-on-one help drain traffic from the system using the <insert drain traffic link>, and proceed to step 10. For reference guides refer to https: www.cisco.com c en us support ios-nx-os-software ios-xr-software products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html for configuration guides.

show bgp <IPV4 IPV6> unicast summary

10) If the problem has not be resolved, collect the following command output:

show bgp <IPV4 IPV6> unicast summary
show bgp policy
show controller npu resources all location <LC> (Run this command for all the linecard)
show dpa resources iproute location <> (Run this command for all the linecard)
admin show platform

                  description: Cisco IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) authentication provides anti-replay protection against duplicating encrypted packets by assigning a unique sequence number to each encrypted packet. It can reject old or duplicate packets to protect itself against replay attacks. The possible triggering conditions for this error to occur are:
1. The IPSec encrypted packets are forwarded out of order by the encrypting router, this is typically a result of QOS (quality of service) configuration on the encrypting router.
2. The IPSec packets received by the decrypting router are out of order due to packet reordering at an intermediate device, most commonly the ISP (Internet service provider) issue.
3. The received IPSec packet is fragmented and requires reassembly before authentication verification and decryption. Since the reassembly process is taking place at the process level, it's possible that by the time the large packet is reassembled, the default smaller packets have already been processed by the crypto engine, thus causing the large packet to miss the anti-replay window.
4. Network latency, transmission path issues.

                       impact: A parity error in the Integrated Packet Processor's Transmit Management Module. This could be a transient hardware issue or a fatal error. There are two groups of parity errors.

Soft Parity Errors:
These errors occur when an energy level within the chip (for example, a one or a zero) changes, most often due to radiation.
When referenced by the CPU, such errors cause the system to crash. In case of a soft parity error, there is no need to swap the board or any of the components.

Hard parity errors
These errors occur when there is a chip or board failure that corrupts data. In this case, you need to re-seat or replace the affected
component, which usually involves a memory chip swap or a board swap.
