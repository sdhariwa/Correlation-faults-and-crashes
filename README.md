# A Predictive ML Model: Correlation of Faults & Crashes
This is a SOAR hackathon project for Team Phoenix.

#### Problem Statement 
The lack of correlation between system faults and crashes in CX Cloud hinders experience, necessitating a comprehensive correlation to enhance system performance. How might we prevent escalation of system issues and provide actionable insights to user?

#### Solution Proposed
The solution is provided by ideating and building a predictive ML model quoting likeliness of an asset's crash % initiating timely preventive measures from userâ€™s end.
