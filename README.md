# A Predictive ML Model: Correlation of Faults & Crashes
This is a SOAR hackathon project for Team Phoenix.

#### Problem Statement 
The lack of correlation between system faults and crashes in CX Cloud hinders experience, necessitating a comprehensive correlation to enhance system performance. How might we prevent escalation of system issues and provide actionable insights to user?

#### Solution Proposed
The solution is provided by ideating and building a predictive ML model quoting likeliness of an asset's crash % initiating timely preventive measures from user’s end.

#### Steps to run
1. Install Anaconda:
    
    • Install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/download.

2. Open Anaconda Navigator:

    • Launch the Anaconda Navigator application on your computer.

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

    • In Anaconda Navigator, find and click on the "Home" tab.
    
    • Locate the Jupyter Notebook icon and click on the "Launch" button.

4. Download Resources and Notebooks:
  
    • Download the data resources from [resources](https://cisco-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/sdhariwa_cisco_com/Documents/Team%20Phoenix/resources?csf=1&web=1&e=7j9rwa) in a directory on your machine.
    
    • Download the notebooks. Make sure the notebooks and data resources are in the same directory.

5. Navigate to the downloaded Notebook:

    • The Jupyter Notebook interface will open in your default web browser.
    
    • Use the file browser to navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) is located.

6. Open an Existing Notebook:
    
    • To open an existing notebook, click on the notebook's name in the file browser.

7. Execute Cells:

    • Once inside a notebook, you'll see cells. You can run a cell by selecting it and clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar, or by pressing Shift + Enter.
    
8. Stop and Restart the Kernel:
  
    • If you encounter issues or want to start afresh, you can stop and restart the kernel. Use the "Kernel" menu for these options.

9. Save and Close:
  
    • Save your work by clicking the "Save" button or using Ctrl + S (Windows/Linux) or Command + S (Mac).
  
    • Close the Jupyter Notebook tab when you are finished.

10. Shut Down Jupyter Notebook:
    
    • After you're done, go back to the Jupyter Notebook dashboard in your web browser.
    
    • Click the "Quit" button next to the running notebook to shut down the Jupyter Notebook.
